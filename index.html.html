       <h1>Internet Protocols and IP Address</h1>
        <p1>Internet protocols are a set of rules and standards that allow devices to communicate with each other over the internet.
         -Some of the internet protocols:Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)-Ensures data is delivered accurately in the correct order.
                                        :Internet Protocol(IP)-handles addressing and routing data to the correct destination.
                                        :HTTP-used for accessing web pages.
                                        :DNS-translates domain names into IP addresses.
                                        :FTP-for transferring files.</p1>

      <h2>Types and versions of IP Addresses</h2>
        <p2>An IP address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each device connected to a network.
            <b>They used in various way:Identify devices,sending and receiving data,routing information,domain name resolutions</b>
            -We have two main versions of IP addresses:IPv4 and IPv6.
            -They have various differences-the IPv4 has 32bits while the IPv6 has 128bits
                                          -IPv4 is slower and more manual configuration while the IPv6 is faster 
                                          -IPv4 security depends on applications while IPv6 has built in security.
            -Their real world applications-IPv4 applications
